### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a developer currently training to become a full-stack developer.

I've recently embarked on my journey to learn JavaScript and have just completed a university-certified full-stack web development bootcamp with a grade of 100%. During the bootcamp, I gained knowledge in the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js

I have a basic understanding of Python and I'm eager to continue growing and expanding my skillset. Currently, I'm focusing on mastering React.js and Node.js. In the future, I plan to learn TypeScript, Java, and explore possibilities with WebGL.

- 🔭 Working on learning and applying JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
- 🍯 Life is sweet when we keep learning.
- 🌱 Currently studying React + Node.js.
- 👀 Excited to explore TypeScript, Python, Java, and WebGL.

Feel free to reach out and connect with me!

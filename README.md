### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a passionate and creative Frontend Engineer with a unique background in music production, audio engineering and visual arts. My journey in web development is driven by an inquisitive approach to problem-solving and a commitment to crafting exceptional user experiences.

Recently, I've been honing my skills in TypeScript, React, and modern frontend technologies while working on SaaS web applications at GoBubble AI Tech Ltd. This role has allowed me to dive deep into mono repository structures, implement accessibility improvements, and lead initiatives in error handling and email system development.

My transition into tech was kickstarted by completing a university-certified full-stack web development bootcamp with a perfect grade of 100%. This achievement, coupled with being recognised as a Top 10 Finalist in the National Coding Challenge by TargetJobs UK, underscores my dedication to excellence in coding.

I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation is at the forefront. My experience spans from translating Figma designs into functional UI components to championing accessibility improvements and refactoring legacy code. I'm versed in React.js, TypeScript, and styled-components,and always seeking to expand my expertise.

Continuous learning is at the core of my ethos. I'm currently enrolled in advanced React and CSS courses to further refine my skills and stay ahead of industry trends.

I'm excited about collaborating on challenging projects that push the boundaries of web development. Let's connect and create impactful digital experiences together!

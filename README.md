### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full-stack developer...

I've recently started my journey learning to code in JavaScript. I'm enrolled in a university-certified, full-time, full-stack web development bootcamp where I have been learning:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- React
- OOP


I am also familiar with the basics of Python.
I am eager to continue to grow and learn and very serious about expanding my skillset, next my focus will be on TypeScript and Node.js, but I am open to all possibilities.

- 🔭 Working on learning and applying JavaScript, React, and Node.js
- 🍯 Life is sweet when we keep learning 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying React + Node.js
-  👀 I'm looking forward to exploring TypeScript, Python, Java, and WebGL

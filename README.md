## ðŸš€ About Me


I'm a passionate and dedicated developer on a mission to create exceptional web experiences. With a good foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and an understanding of UX and UI design.

Recently, I embarked on my journey to learn JavaScript and successfully completed a university-certified full-stack web development bootcamp with a grade of 100%. This intensive program provided me with valuable hands-on experience and honed my skills in building web applications.

During this journey, I had the honor of being recognized as a Top 10 Finalist in the National Coding Challenge by TargetJobs UK. This achievement highlights my problem-solving abilities, collaborative mindset, and determination to excel in competitive coding environments.

Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I continuously seek to expand my skillset and stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry. With a focus on React.js and Node.js, I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my expertise.

I believe that life is a continuous learning process, and I'm excited to embrace new technologies and explore areas such as TypeScript, Python, Java, and even the fascinating world of WebGL.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects that will leave a lasting impact! Feel free to reach out and join me on this exhilarating coding journey.
